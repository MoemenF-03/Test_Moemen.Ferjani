To create this project, I focused on several key aspects:

*Main Page Structure: 
 - I constructed a main page that serves as the central hub
 for users to view their cart and wishlist.

*Data Fetching: 
 - Using the fetch method,
 I retrieved product data from a JSON file.
 This data is then dynamically populated into sliders on the main page,
 showcasing various products for users to browse.

*Styling: 
 - I applied CSS to style the entire application,
 ensuring that it not only functions well but also looks visually appealing.
 The styling was a personal effort, reflecting my design choices and preferences.

*Functionality: 
 - I implemented JavaScript functions to manage the addition and removal of items
 from both the cart and the wishlist. This included updating counts and dynamically rendering items
 as users interact with the application.
